UA_INFO: |-
  **About User Agent**
    The user agent is used to access interfaces that the robot cannot access, such as:
    - Delete user's all messages
    - Report message
    - Search user history
    - Wait...
    If you set the user agent of this project as a group manager, additional functions are available.
    Due to the limited number of groups that users can join and multi-agent has not yet been implemented, you need to [apply]({}) to use user agent.
